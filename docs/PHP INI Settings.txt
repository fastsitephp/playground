# See notes from [Playground Server Setup.txt]
# The [php.ini] file is manually edited with these values.
# Some of the functions to disable will not exist when PHP is built
# using the instructions from [PHP Custom Build Instructions.txt].
#
# The purpose of disabled functions and settings:
#   1) Disable file writing outside of the admin app
#       - A single users could easily fill up disk space if allowed to write files
#   2) Prevent network communication on the server (HTTP Requests, Sending emails, etc)
#       - Spammers could easily take of the server and generate a lot of charges
#         and use the server for malicious purposes.
#   3) Prevent too many resources from being used
#       - Because users have the ability to defined any PHP code it's easy to
#         cause CPU spikes, however limits are in place (small memory and quick timeouts).
#   4) These settings also depend on the custom PHP build for file writing
#      and settings from a local [.htaccess] file for each user site.
#   5) Some of the disabled classes many be ok to allow. Further review of PHP source code
#      is needed to decide for certain. For example, do the blocked classes use settings
#      from [open_basedir] or do they allow full server access. More time is needed to
#      determine this; and also if other allowed PHP functions/classes should be allowed
#      or blocked.
